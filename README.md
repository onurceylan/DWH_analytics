# DWH_analytics
This project builds on my DWH design work. It's a collection of SQL scripts I've put together for exploring data, running analyses, and building reports. The scripts cover different analytical needs. Things like discovering what is in your database, calculating key metrics, spotting trends over time, running cumulative analyses, breaking data into segments, and more. I designed this repository to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data in relational databases. Each script tackles a specific analytical challenge and demonstrates practical SQL query patterns.
